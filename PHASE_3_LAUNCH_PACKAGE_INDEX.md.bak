### Document 5: PHASE_3_RISK_MANAGEMENT.md

**File Size:** ~150 KB | **Length:** ~4,200 lines  
**Primary Audience:** @ARCHITECT, Engineering Managers, Leadership  
**Purpose:** Top 5 risks with detailed mitigation strategies & decision gates

**Contents:**

- Executive summary (5 critical/high risks identified, all managed)
- Risk portfolio (2 critical, 3 high, 7 medium, 5 low)

**RISK #1: Distributed RPC Synchronization Overhead** 🔴 CRITICAL

- Probability: 70% | Impact: 15-20% throughput loss
- 4-tier mitigation:
  - TIER 1: Design optimization (week 1-2, measure overhead)
  - TIER 2: Implementation (week 2-3, use proven patterns)
  - TIER 3: Fallback (if >15%, reduce node count or increase batch)
  - TIER 4: Acceptance (if <15%, proceed normally)
- Decision gate: End Week 2 (measure 2-node speedup, need 1.65×+)
- Owner: @APEX

**RISK #2: Quantization Accuracy Loss > 2%** 🟠 HIGH

- Probability: 40% | Impact: Reduced model quality
- 4-tier mitigation:
  - TIER 1: High-quality calibration (weeks 5-6)
  - TIER 2: Multi-strategy framework (GPTQ, AWQ, 8-bit)
  - TIER 3: Fallback (if >2%, use 8-bit or mixed-precision)
  - TIER 4: Acceptance (if <1%, declare success)
- Decision gate: End Week 6 (MMLU <1% loss?)
- Owner: @VELOCITY

**RISK #3: Extended Context (32K) Too Expensive** 🟠 HIGH

- Probability: 45% | Impact: Cap context at 8K-16K instead of 32K
- 4-tier mitigation:
  - TIER 1: Sparse attention implementation (weeks 7-8)
  - TIER 2: KV-cache compression (FP8 quantization)
  - TIER 3: Segmentation fallback (process context in chunks)
  - TIER 4: Acceptance (cap at achievable limit)
- Decision gate: End Week 8 (32K @ <250ms/token?)
- Owner: @ARCHITECT

**RISK #4: Timeline Pressure** 🟠 HIGH

- Probability: 50% | Impact: Slip to Q3 2026
- 4-tier mitigation:
  - TIER 1: Risk-driven development (tackle hard problems first)
  - TIER 2: Aggressive testing & prototyping
  - TIER 3: Parallel workstreams (already designed)
  - TIER 4: Scope flexibility (Tier 1 MUST-HAVE, Tier 2 SHOULD-HAVE, Tier 3 NICE-TO-HAVE)
- Decision gate: Each sprint end (on schedule?)
- Owner: @ARCHITECT (with Eng Manager)

**RISK #5: Multi-Model Memory Conflicts** 🟡 MEDIUM

- Probability: 35% | Impact: Can only load 1-2 models instead of 3+
- 4-tier mitigation:
  - TIER 1: Design for multi-model (pre-alloc, NUMA-aware)
  - TIER 2: Implementation (dedicated allocators, lifecycle mgmt)
  - TIER 3: Testing & validation (measure interference)
  - TIER 4: Fallback (cap at 2 models, plan Phase 4 for 3+)
- Decision gate: End Week 12 (2 models working with <10% interference?)
- Owner: @ARCHITECT

- Weekly risk review template (status, metrics, actions)
- Escalation procedures (identify → assess → decide → execute → close)

**When to Use:**

- Risk identification & assessment
- Mitigation strategy planning
- Weekly team reviews (is this risk becoming real?)
- Decision gate meetings (pass/fail criteria)
- Escalation procedures (what to do if risk happens)

**Key Quote:** _"RPC overhead (Risk #1) is biggest unknown. Decision point: End of Week 2. If overhead >15%, we pivot to reduced distributed scope or increased batching. Not a blocker, just requires scope flexibility."_

### Document 6: PHASE_3_SUCCESS_METRICS_DASHBOARD.md

**File Size:** ~200 KB | **Length:** ~5,000 lines  
**Primary Audience:** All Team, @VELOCITY, @ECLIPSE, Leadership  
**Purpose:** How we measure success + validation methodology

- Executive summary (12 metrics across 4 dimensions)

**PERFORMANCE METRICS (7):**

1. Single-node throughput: 120 tok/s (2.16× improvement)
2. Distributed throughput (2 GPUs): 200 tok/s (1.67× scaling)
3. Continuous batch throughput: 220 tok/s (1.83× improvement)
4. Time to first token: P50 <100ms
5. Per-token latency: P50 <30ms, P99 <50ms
6. Memory footprint: <9GB (40% reduction)
7. Context length: 16K tokens (4× improvement)

**QUALITY METRICS (3):**

1. Task accuracy (MMLU, HellaSwag, ARC): <1.5% loss
2. Quantization accuracy loss: <1% average
3. Fine-tuning quality: <0.5% additional degradation

**RELIABILITY METRICS (3):**

1. Uptime: 99.9%
2. Error rate: <0.1%
3. MTBF: >1000 hours (verified via 72-hour stress test)

**ENGINEERING METRICS (3):**

1. Code coverage: >90%
2. Documentation: 100% of public APIs documented
3. Architecture complexity: Avg <5 cyclomatic complexity per function

**For Each Metric:**

- What we measure
- Baseline/target values
- How we measure (test harness, tools)
- Why it matters (business impact)
- When measured (weekly/sprint/release)
- Success criteria (pass/conditional/fail)

**Measurement Tools:**

- Performance: Custom Python harness, torch.profiler
- Quality: lm-evaluation-harness (MMLU/HellaSwag/ARC)
- Reliability: Prometheus, Grafana, custom health checks
- Engineering: pytest-cov, sphinx, radon

**Dashboards (Real-time):**

- Performance Dashboard (throughput, latency, memory, context)
- Reliability Dashboard (uptime %, error rate, MTBF)
- Quality Dashboard (code coverage, test results, accuracy)

**Validation Plan:**

- Sprint-level validation (weekly Friday benchmarks)
- Pre-release validation (mandatory 72-hour certification)
- Release sign-off checklist (ALL metrics must pass)

**When to Use:**

- Weekly progress tracking (are we meeting targets?)
- Performance optimization (what's the current tok/s?)
- Quality validation (is accuracy within spec?)
- Release decision (ready to ship?)
- Troubleshooting (why is latency high?)

**Key Quote:** _"12 metrics define success. All must pass for v3.0 release. No exceptions. Performance + Quality + Reliability + Engineering all critical. Release sign-off requires 72-hour certification with <0.1% error rate and MTBF >1000h."_
