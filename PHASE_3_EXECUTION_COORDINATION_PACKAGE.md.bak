## 🚨 Escalation Framework

**Response Time SLAs**:

| Type             | SLA                                  | Example                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Critical blocker | 30 min response, <2 hours resolution | Build failure, GPU down, major regression |
| High priority    | 1 hour response, <4 hours resolution | Blocks one person, design decision needed |
| Medium           | 4 hours response, <1 day resolution  | Slows work, resource issue                |
| Low              | 1 day response, <1 week resolution   | Nice-to-have, tech debt                   |

**Escalation Path**:

```
Team Member Report Issue
  ↓
Team Lead (@APEX, @VELOCITY, etc.) - 15 min
  ↓
@ARCHITECT - 30 min response
  ↓
@OMNISCIENT - 1 hour for high-severity
```
